__**This repo is now archived, it's code has been moved to our Tools Mono-repo: https://github.com/canonn-science/canonn-tools**__

This will find codex entries within jump range of two systems. Its used to plot a route for the Gnosis. Typically you would choose two systems approximately 1000Ly apart and the tool will find a system between them that has anything of interest
